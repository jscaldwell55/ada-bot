# Rounds Query Fix - Summary

## Problem
Rounds were successfully created in the database but not returned when querying the session. The API always returned `rounds: []` even though direct SQL queries showed the rounds existed.

## Root Cause
Supabase's PostgREST relationship syntax needed to explicitly specify the foreign key column name for the join to work reliably.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Explicit Foreign Key Syntax** (app/api/sessions/[id]/route.ts)
Changed from:
```typescript
rounds:emotion_rounds(*)
```

To:
```typescript
rounds:emotion_rounds!session_id(*)
```

The `!session_id` explicitly tells PostgREST which foreign key column to use for the relationship.

### 2. **Fallback Query**
Added a fallback that manually fetches rounds if the relationship returns empty:
```typescript
if (!session.rounds || session.rounds.length === 0) {
  const { data: roundsData } = await supabase
    .from('emotion_rounds')
    .select('*')
    .eq('session_id', sessionId)
    .order('round_number', { ascending: true })

  if (roundsData) {
    session.rounds = roundsData
  }
}
```

### 3. **Schema Cache Reload**
Ran `npx tsx scripts/force-schema-reload.ts` to ensure PostgREST recognized the updated schema.

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed logging to help diagnose future issues:
- Logs rounds count from join
- Logs when fallback query is used
- Logs raw session object for debugging

## Testing

### Verify the Fix
1. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create a new session and test**:
   - Navigate to a child page
   - Start a new session
   - Watch the console logs

3. **Expected logs**:
   ```
   [SessionPage] Creating round 1...
   [SessionPage] ✅ Round created: <round-id>
   [useSession] Round updated via realtime: {...}
   [API] Session fetched: { roundsCount: 1, ... }
   ```

### Diagnostic Queries
Run these in Supabase Studio to verify the database structure:

```sql
-- 1. Verify foreign key exists
SELECT
  tc.constraint_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name = 'emotion_rounds'
  AND kcu.column_name = 'session_id';

-- 2. Test manual join
SELECT
  s.id,
  er.id as round_id,
  er.round_number
FROM sessions s
LEFT JOIN emotion_rounds er ON er.session_id = s.id
WHERE s.id = '<your-session-id>'
ORDER BY er.round_number;
```

## Why This Happened

Supabase's PostgREST uses PostgreSQL foreign keys to detect relationships. When you use the syntax `table_name(*)`, it tries to automatically detect which foreign key to use. However, this can fail if:

1. **Multiple foreign keys exist** between tables
2. **Schema cache is stale** (PostgREST didn't reload after migrations)
3. **Ambiguous relationship names** (table has multiple FKs to same target)

Using the explicit syntax `table_name!foreign_key_column(*)` removes the ambiguity.

## Additional Changes

### Frontend Improvements (Already Applied by User)
The user added:
- Polling mechanism as a fallback for realtime
- Better logging in useSession hook
- Race condition prevention with `isFetching` ref
- Silent refresh to avoid UI freezing

### Files Modified
- ✅ `app/api/sessions/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed query + added fallback
- ✅ `scripts/force-schema-reload.ts` - Already existed (ran successfully)
- ✅ `diagnostic-queries.sql` - Created for debugging

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Round creation** (~4 seconds for AI generation)
2. **API returns round immediately** via explicit join
3. **If join fails**, fallback query fetches rounds
4. **Realtime subscription** updates UI silently
5. **Polling fallback** ensures UI updates even if realtime fails
6. **No more freeze** - UI stays interactive throughout

## Monitoring

Watch for these console logs to verify everything works:
- `[API] Session fetched:` - Should show roundsCount > 0
- `[API] No rounds in join, fetching separately...` - Fallback activated (shouldn't happen often)
- `[useSession] Round updated via realtime:` - Realtime working
- `[SessionPage] Polling attempt N...` - Polling active (stops after round appears)

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Supabase logs** in dashboard for PostgREST errors
2. **Run diagnostic queries** (see diagnostic-queries.sql)
3. **Verify service role key** is set in .env.local
4. **Check RLS policies** aren't blocking reads
5. **Restart Supabase locally** if using local development: `npx supabase stop && npx supabase start`
