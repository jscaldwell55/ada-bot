-- Database Seeding SQL for Ada
-- This is an alternative to the TypeScript seed script
-- Run this directly in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Clear existing seed data (optional - comment out to preserve data)
-- DELETE FROM stories;
-- DELETE FROM regulation_scripts;

-- Note: You'll need to manually insert the JSON data from stories.json and scripts.json
-- This SQL file provides the structure. For automated seeding, use content/seed.ts instead

-- Example story insert (repeat for all stories from stories.json):
INSERT INTO stories (id, title, text, emotion, age_band, complexity_score, created_at)
